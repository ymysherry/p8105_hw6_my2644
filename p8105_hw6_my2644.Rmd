## Problem 1


```{r}
homicide_df =
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1
    )
  ) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
        
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```


start with one city



```{r}
baltimore_df= 
    homicide_df %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex,
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>%
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```
